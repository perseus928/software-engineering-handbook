# Contributing to the Handbook

Thank you for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the contents of the 
Software Engineering Handbook, which are hosted on 
[software-engineering-handbook.com][1]. 

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free 
to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Typical Contribution Workflows

There are two extremes of workflows for contributing contents to the 
Software Engineering Handbook:

- The [simple workflow](simple_flow.md) requires almost no initial setup, but is limited
- The [advanced workflow](advanced_flow.md) requires knowledge of forking and using Git.

The use of anyone of these two workflows, or even a combination of them, is **acceptable**.
