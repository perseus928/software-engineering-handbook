# SSH Protocol

The [SSH protocol][1] (also referred to as **Secure Shell**) is a method for secure remote login 
from one computer to another. It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and 
it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption.

The protocol works in the **client-server model**, which means that the connection is established by 
the **SSH client** connecting to the **SSH server**. The SSH client drives the connection setup 
process and uses public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server. After the setup 
phase, the SSH protocol uses strong symmetric encryption and hashing algorithms to ensure the 
privacy and integrity of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.
