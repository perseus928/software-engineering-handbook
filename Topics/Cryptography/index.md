# Cryptography

Cryptography is the practice of secret writing in the presence of third parties called adversaries. 

There are two close terms; Cryptology and Cryptanalysis. Cryptology is the study of codes, and 
Cryptanalysis is the art of breaking codes of others. 

The process of converting ordinary plain text into unintelligible text and vice-versa, generally
involves the following elements:

- Plaintext: unencrypted data
- Ciphertext: plaintext is encrypted into ciphertext
- Encryption method: cryptography scheme
- Key or Salt: random data that is used as an additional input to the cryptography scheme

Cryptography has several uses, such as secure information exchange, authentication, data integrity
certification, and more.
