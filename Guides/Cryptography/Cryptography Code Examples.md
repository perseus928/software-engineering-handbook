# Cryptography Code Examples

A [GitHub repository][1] dedicated for [Cryptography][2] code examples covers the following:

- **Substitution ciphers** - [GitHub Repo (Python)][3]: 

    - caesar_cipher - [Try it out!][4]
    - deranged_alphabet_cipher - [Try it out!][5]

- **Book ciphers**: [GitHub Repo (JavaScript)][6]:

    - book_cipher_async - [Try it out!][7]
    - book_cipher_sync - [Try it out!][8]

**Notes**: 

1. All the above code samples can be tried interactively using [Repl.it][9]:
    - You can run the code as-is (using the green `Run >` button at the top)
    - You can also experiment with modifying the code
2. The [Cryptography GitHub repository][1] includes detailed description of the code
