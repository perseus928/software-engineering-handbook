# Software Engineering Handbook


The contents of this repository is used to dynamically build the [Software Engineering Handbook][1] 
site. 

The main two data elements in this repository are:

- **Authored content** that is accessible to the end user from the handbook navigation tree 
- **Configuration data files** to construct the handbook navigation tree

Contributors are invited to propose additions and improvements to any of these two elements.

# Key Concepts and Principles

The `Handbook/` directory hierarchy represents an instance of a handbook, which is created 
automatically based on the `*.yml` configuration files in config/navigation/ directory. The starting
point for the navigation tree configuration is the `root.yml` file.

See the `config/navigation/` [README][2] file for more information on the structure of the navigation 
configuration files.

The idea is to isolate the actual content of the handbook, given under `Guides/` and `Topics/` 
directories, from the navigation experience. This makes a robust and easily maintained repository, 
which supports relatively easy changes to the handbook structure and the navigation experiences.

The Handbook tree hierarchy includes directories and index.md files. All the directories under
the `Handbook/` directory have capitalized names with spaces ('Humanized' style), which represent 
the exact names of the Software Engineering Handbook chapters and sections.

We distinguish between **intermediate Handbook directories** (i.e., directories having one or more 
child directories) and **terminal Handbook directories** (i.e., directories having no child 
directories).

Each 'intermediate Handbook directory' contains an `index.md` file that includes, among other 
optional parts, a contents list pointing to the child directories of the hosting directory (i.e., 
next level of the Handbook directory hierarchy).

Each 'terminal Handbook directory' also contains an `index.md` file pointing to one or more guides or 
topics that are relevant to the hosting directory (i.e., in the context of the entire navigation 
path leading from the Handbook root to the hosting directory).

See the `config/metadata/` [README][3] file for more information on the structure of the navigation 
`index.md` files and on how they are composed automatically using metadata and Jinja2 template.

The entire content of the `Handboo/` directory (i.e., directory hierarchy and all the index.md files)
is automatically generated and maintained by the automation scripts in the [tools repository][4],
based on the configuration files under the `config/` directory.

### Note on the use of README.md and index.md files

`REAME.md` files are intended for *contributors* and are rendered by default as `index.html` by 
**GitHub repository** site.

However, `index.md` files are intended for the *end users* visiting the 
[Software Engineering Handbook][1] site. These files get priority by **GitHub pages** over 
neighboring `README.md` files when translating them to `index.html` files. GitHub pages is responsible 
for translating all the Markdown files in the repository and exporting them as static html files to 
a standalone web site.
