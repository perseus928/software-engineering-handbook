# GitLab Overview

GitLab is the first single application for all stages of the DevOps lifecycle. GitLab enables Concurrent DevOps, unlocking organizations from the constraints of the toolchain. GitLab provides unmatched visibility, higher levels of efficiency, and comprehensive governance. This makes the software lifecycle 3 times faster, radically improving the speed of business.

Gitlab can be used to host source code, to setup build pipelines, to plan work, to store artifacts, to deploy work and to collaborate about work.

Gitlab is Open Source and can be used freely.
