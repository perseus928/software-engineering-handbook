# Docker Installation

The [Docker Community Edition (CE)][1] is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get 
started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps. It is available on multiple 
platforms. Use the [**Supported platforms**][2] tables to choose the best installation path for 
you.

For annotated instructions on how to install Docker CE on Debian based Linux distributions, such as 
Ubuntu, see the [detailed docker installation instructions][3].
